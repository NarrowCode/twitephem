## A tweet manipulation tool
Written in python, using the [Python-Twitter](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) API, this tool allows you to manipulate your own tweets from the command line. Can be executed periodically to generate an ephemeral twitter account.

## Installation
    pip install python-twitter

## Usage
    Place your own Twitter API key in the _api.txt file. Make sure to keep the file in the .gitignore and manage the permissions properly.
